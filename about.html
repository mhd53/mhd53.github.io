## About

Hello! I am a senior College student currently majoring in Natural Sciences. My life adventure led me to becoming an indenpendent programmer. Starting with Python as my first programming language I've come to find what my true passion is. Besides learning, I like to workout, and slove problems.

<small>
My life motto is simple: You only live once. Make sure you make it. And what defines my style is "Divide and Conquer".
</small>

<small>
Sometimes things don't go the way we want it to and we might be drifted away from what we are aiming for, but these are the times where it's most important to keep the
eyes on the goal and remain fearless!

Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.

<small>
Octocat is Github's logo and trademark and here is used to illustrate a fictional character (John Smith) that used the *{ Personal }* Jekyll Theme to build his website.
